University project of the course "TECNICHE AVANZATE DI PROGRAMMAZIONE" of the computer science university of Genoa

# Online Auction Site

This project implemented core functionality for an online auction site.

## Key Features

* User account management

  * Secure password hashing and salting
  
  * Account creation, login, sessions
  
* Auction hosting

  * Creating, bidding, ending auctions
  
  * Winner selection, current highest bid
  
  * Automatic cleanup of expired data
  
* Multiple site support

  * Isolated sites with separate users, auctions
  
  * Site management interfaces
  
* Background process

  * Sessions, auctions expiring automatically
  
  * Robust exception handling
  
## Key Technologies

* C#

  * Object-oriented design principles
  
  * Entity Framework Core for database access
  
* SQL Server database

* Unit testing

## What I Learned

Through this project I gained experience with:

* Building a complex system across multiple layers (business logic, data access, database)

* Modeling complex processes into classes and methods

* Handling concurrency issues with shared data 

* Designing intuitive interfaces and abstractions

* Testing business logic code paths

This project shows my ability to take on significant programming challenges using languages like C# and following standard software engineering practices. The auction site logic demonstrates skills in areas like security, robustness, maintainability that are valuable across many software roles.
